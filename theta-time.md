# Theta Time Framework

## Overview
**Theta Time** is a manifestation alignment framework that quantifies the interaction between personal emotional intention and environmental field coherence. It provides a way to determine when the field is most responsive to internal signals—when reality is most likely to bend.

At its core, Theta Time translates internal emotional dynamics and external cosmic-field conditions into a single qualitative insight: **"Is this the moment to act, trust, or wait?"**

## Core Equation

### Emotional Curvature Angle:
```math
\theta(t) = \arctan\left( \frac{\partial E(t)}{\partial \text{PDI}(t)} \right)
```

Where:
- **E(t)** = Emotional intention strength, on a scale from -1 to +1
- **PDI(t)** = Planetary Disturbance Index, representing real-time field coherence
- **θ(t)** = The angle of field response or "emotional curvature" — how sharply your internal signal is influencing the external field

## Emotional Intention Scale (E(t))
| Value | Emotional State                          | Description                                          |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| -1.0   | Lust, desperation, self-doubt             | Intention from lack or control — distorted signal    |
| -0.5   | Anxious striving, conditional desire      | Emotion is charged but not clean                     |
|  0.0   | Apathy, detachment, emotional neutrality  | No signal sent — non-magnetic state                  |
| +0.5   | Hope, openness, curious wanting           | Partial alignment, low coherence                     |
| +1.0   | Love, trust, surrendered knowing          | Fully coherent, purpose-driven manifestation state   |

## Field Coherence (PDI)
The PDI represents the coherence of the external field. A higher PDI means the field is structured, synchronized, and more likely to respond to internal cues. A lower PDI means fragmentation, noise, or chaos.

## Interpreting θ(t): Emotional Curvature Zones

| θ(t) Range       | Zone           | Label         | Meaning                                               |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 0°–15°           | Flat           | Still         | Field unresponsive; too early to act                  |
| 15°–35°          | Warming        | Priming       | Energy building; good time for vision & prep          |
| 35°–55°          | Responsive     | Curving       | Field is beginning to bend; synchronicities likely    |
| 55°–75°          | Tipping Point  | Bending       | High manifestation potential; act with alignment      |
| >75°             | Warp Window    | Singularity   | Peak curvature; events already in motion              |
| < 0°             | Resolution     | Letting Go    | Emotional signal decreasing; field may carry intent   |

## Practical Application (UX Layer)

### What Users See:

Rather than showing the raw θ(t) number, users receive:
- **Momentum Strength Label** (e.g., "Warming", "Bending", etc.)
- **Interpretive Message**, such as:
  - "The field is beginning to respond. Align action with your desire."
  - "Reality is curving sharply around your intention. Expect shifts."
  - "Let go. The field is carrying your intent now. Trust the unfolding."

---

## Implications
- **Theta Time makes manifestation measurable**
- It provides a timing system grounded in real field conditions, not guesswork
- It enables self-awareness: "Is my desire pure, or distorted?"
- It creates a new layer of field intelligence: a compass for conscious creation

---

## Summary
Theta Time is the moment when your emotional intention meets a responsive field. It is the curve in reality you’ve been waiting for — and now, you can measure it.

> When the angle steepens, so does the chance that your inner world becomes your outer one.

**Technical Note:** θ(t) is computed internally and mapped to momentum strength zones. User-facing layers are purely qualitative.
