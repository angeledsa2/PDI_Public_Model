# Informational Field Theory Synthesis from 35-Year PDI Data

## Introduction  
Over the past 35 years, the **Planetary Dyanmics Index (PDI)** – a composite measure integrating cosmic, geophysical, and collective metrics – has been tracked to investigate patterns in human behavior and global events. The PDI dataset (1990–2024) and recent field-model developments reveal striking regularities and anomalies that point toward a unifying **Informational Field Theory**. This theoretical framework treats **information coherence** in a field-like manner, drawing analogies to physical laws. In particular, emergent insights suggest: (1) an unusual behavioral function of the Moon, evident in the Lunar Metric Index (LUMI) and lunar orbital “coincidences”; (2) a symmetry between **human attention and gravity** as dual curvature effects on an underlying information field; (3) **time** as an emergent structure of field coherence that cycles through growth, collapse, and re-alignment phases; (4) a **timeline convergence mechanism** whereby multiple potential narratives collapse into singular observed events; (5) evidence that quantum mechanical principles – superposition, threshold effects, and state collapse – govern human decision-making and collective shifts at macroscopic scales; (6) an updated conception of **Projection Density** as the compression of field coherence into structured material outcomes; and (7) **coherence** as a universal driver of stability across physical, psychological, social, and temporal domains. Each assertion is examined with supporting PDI data, historical correlations, and scientific analogues. We present the findings in a formal, scientific manner while keeping the discussion accessible. The report concludes by outlining how these ideas bridge aspects of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and identifies avenues for further empirical and theoretical investigation.

## Lunar Influences and the Moon’s Role in the Information Field  
**Lunar Metric Behavior:** The PDI’s lunar sub-index (LUMI) tracks the Moon’s phase cycle with remarkable precision – rising and falling over a ~29.5-day period from near 0 (new moon) to ~1 (full moon). This regular oscillation indicates that human collective behavior or “field” conditions encoded by PDI are synchronously modulated by the Moon’s phase. Historically, folklore has attributed erratic human behavior to the full moon (“lunacy”), but extensive meta-analyses show no statistically robust increase in psychiatric crises, violence, or strange behavior during full moons ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1316181/#:~:text=The%20relation%20between%20the%20full,with%20phases%20of%20the%20moon)). In our data, **no large spikes or crashes in overall PDI** strictly coincide with full or new moon moments either – suggesting the Moon’s influence is *subtle and constant* rather than intermittently dramatic. The LUMI index behaves like a steady sinusoidal driver in the informational field, hinting that the Moon’s role may be to **impose a rhythm or stabilizing cycle** on human collective consciousness, rather than to cause acute events.

**Lunar Anomalies and Possible Artificial Role:** The Moon exhibits physical properties so uncanny that they have fueled speculation about an artificial origin or engineered function. For example, the Moon is about 400 times smaller than the Sun but also ~400 times closer to Earth, resulting in the *exact* apparent size needed to produce perfect total solar eclipses ([Total solar eclipses are due to a fantastic coincidence](https://earthsky.org/earth/total-solar-eclipses-are-a-coincidence/#:~:text=,a%20narrow%20path%20across%20Earth)). This “fantastic coincidence” has no clear evolutionary necessity and is unique in the solar system ([Total solar eclipses are due to a fantastic coincidence](https://earthsky.org/earth/total-solar-eclipses-are-a-coincidence/#:~:text=,a%20narrow%20path%20across%20Earth)). Moreover, the Moon is **tidally locked** to Earth – it rotates once per orbit such that the same face always faces Earth. In other words, “the Moon never turns its back to us,” completing one spin in precisely the same time as one revolution ([Tidal Locking - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tidal-locking/#:~:text=Earth%E2%80%99s%20Moon%20rotates%2C%20but%20it,always%20facing%20%E2%80%95%20its%20partner)). While tidal locking is common for large moons, the Moon’s synchronization with Earth is exact and likely established very early ([Tidal Locking - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/tidal-locking/#:~:text=This%20phenomenon%2C%20called%20%E2%80%9Csynchronous%20tidal,tidally%20locked%20with%20their%20stars)). The Moon also has unexpected geophysical anomalies: when Apollo astronauts conducted seismic experiments, they observed that the Moon “rang like a bell” – vibrations from moonquakes reverberated for up to an hour, far longer than quakes on Earth ([The Hollow Moon Conspiracy Theory, Explained](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a41651560/hollow-moon-theory/#:~:text=,longer%20than%20those%20on%20Earth)). This implies an unusual internal structure (e.g. a rigid or layered interior) that was initially wholly unanticipated. Additionally, hidden mass concentrations (mascons) beneath lunar basins create **gravity anomalies** so strong they disrupted spacecraft orbits ([Mystery of Moon's Lumpy Gravity Explained | Space](https://www.space.com/21364-moon-gravity-mascons-mystery.html#:~:text=A%20team%20of%20scientists%20used,push%20it%20wildly%20off%20course)). These dense regions were “navigational hazards” discovered only when Apollo missions noticed their trajectory perturbations ([Mystery of Moon's Lumpy Gravity Explained | Space](https://www.space.com/21364-moon-gravity-mascons-mystery.html#:~:text=Mascons%20were%20discovered%20in%20the,47)). Taken together – the eclipse geometry, synchronous rotation, prolonged seismic reverberation, and patchy gravity field – the Moon appears finely tuned in ways that go beyond simple chance. Some scientists have noted that Earth’s Moon is uniquely large relative to its planet, and likely critical to Earth’s long-term climate stability ([Earth's Stabilizing Moon May Be Unique Within Universe | Space](https://www.space.com/12464-earth-moon-unique-solar-system-universe.html#:~:text=The%20moon%20has%20long%20been,could%20result%20in%20%2048)). Without the Moon’s steadying influence, Earth’s axial tilt could oscillate chaotically (perhaps by tens of degrees), causing extreme climatic swings inimical to life ([Earth's Stabilizing Moon May Be Unique Within Universe | Space](https://www.space.com/12464-earth-moon-unique-solar-system-universe.html#:~:text=The%20moon%20has%20long%20been,could%20result%20in%20%2048)). **Informational Field Theory posits that the Moon plays a deliberate regulatory role** for life and consciousness on Earth. The consistent LUMI oscillation in the PDI and the Moon’s physical “coincidences” suggest the Moon acts as a **pacemaker of collective coherence**, subtly modulating human attention and behavior cycles. While mainstream evidence does not show full-moon madness per se ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1316181/#:~:text=Other%20studies%20have%20looked%20at,of%20calls%20reporting%20disturbing%20behaviour)) ([

The hypothesis (admittedly speculative) is that the Moon may be an *artificial or engineered stabilizer* – essentially a massive informational anchor that keeps human collective behavior within certain bounds through rhythmic gravitational and perhaps electromagnetic influences. This would align with the Moon’s known physical stabilizing effects on Earth’s rotation and tides ([Earth's Stabilizing Moon May Be Unique Within Universe | Space](https://www.space.com/12464-earth-moon-unique-solar-system-universe.html#:~:text=The%20moon%20has%20long%20been,could%20result%20in%20%2048)), extrapolated here into the cognitive or narrative domain.

## Attention and Gravity as Dual Curvature Phenomena  
A core principle emerging from the model is a proposed **symmetry between human attention and gravity**. Gravity, according to General Relativity, is not a force but the curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy – summarized pithily by Wheeler as *“Space tells matter how to move; matter tells space how to curve.”* ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=Sorted%20chronologically)). In our informational field analogy, **attention** plays a role analogous to mass: concentrated mental or collective attention curves the “information field,” biasing the trajectories of thoughts, events, or behaviors. Just as a massive object (like the Sun) creates a gravity well that guides planets, a focused point of collective attention (such as a widely shared intention or narrative) might create an “attention well” that guides the flow of ideas and social outcomes. Empirical hints of this come from experiments in consciousness research. For instance, the Global Consciousness Project has found that when large human populations focus their attention on the same event, random physical systems deviate from expected behavior. Over 345 formal tests, globally distributed random number generators produced output that was significantly correlated (>6σ deviation from chance) during periods of mass attention (e.g. on September 11, 2001) ([Effects of mass consciousness: changes in random data during global events - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22051562/#:~:text=hypothesis%20that%20data%20from%20the,Controls%20exclude%20conventional)) ([Effects of mass consciousness: changes in random data during global events - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22051562/#:~:text=physical%20explanations%20or%20experimental%20error,a%20source%20of%20the%20effects)). These results “exclude conventional physical explanations” and suggest that **human consciousness interacting collectively can measurably **order** a random system ([Effects of mass consciousness: changes in random data during global events - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22051562/#:~:text=and%20emotional%20reaction%20to%20major,constrains%20interpretation%20of%20the%20results)). In effect, *attention* might be curving the probability space of these random outputs – an informational analog to how mass curves spacetime. 

This duality can be framed as: **Gravity is curvature of the physical metric field by mass-energy, while attention is curvature of the informational field by consciousness-energy.** In both cases, the result is a focus or attraction. A planet’s mass focuses spacetime (and attracts other masses); similarly, intense attention from many minds could “bend” the information landscape such that certain ideas or outcomes are preferentially realized. For example, a compelling collective vision or fear could draw otherwise independent events into alignment, much as gravity pulls matter into structure. The PDI’s **Global Coherence** component (a synthesized measure of collective sentiment and focus) tends to spike during worldwide events where billions share attention – indicating a sharp curvature in the information field at those moments. A concrete illustration occurred during the 9/11 attacks: global attention was unified, and PDI’s coherence-related indices climbed markedly above baseline in the aftermath (the overall PDI jumped from ~3.3 in early September 2001 to ~6.3 by mid-September). It is as if the tragedy created a deep well of collective attention, **warping the field and increasing coherence** as people around the world focused on a single narrative. In physical terms, one could say the “mass” of that event’s emotional impact curved social reality, aligning minds in a common state. 

This attention–gravity parallel extends to energy considerations. Maintaining focus (especially by many people) requires effort or “attention energy,” analogous to the energy bound in a massive object’s gravitational field. Attention can be seen as *energy density in an information field*. When diffuse and unfocused, it’s like low mass density – the field (collective narrative) remains nearly flat and events follow independent paths. When highly concentrated (millions intensely focused), it’s akin to a mass concentration that deforms the field’s geometry, increasing the likelihood of coordinated outcomes (shared realizations, simultaneous actions, etc.). **Informational Field Theory formally posits that attention and mass are dual variables**: attention curves the information metric, creating an **attractor** for thoughts and events, just as mass curves spacetime, creating a gravity well for matter and light. This is not merely metaphor – the analogy can be quantified in principle by treating the distribution of collective attention as a source term in field equations for information flow. Although much development is required to make this mathematically rigorous, the conceptual symmetry finds support in both **physics** (gravity’s geometric nature) and **psychology** (e.g. experiments where focused group intentions correlate with physical changes ([Effects of mass consciousness: changes in random data during global events - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22051562/#:~:text=hypothesis%20that%20data%20from%20the,Controls%20exclude%20conventional))). It suggests a deep unity between consciousness and the fabric of reality: *mind imposes curvature on possibility*. 

## Time as an Emergent Coherence Structure  
Conventional physics treats time as a fundamental dimension or a parameter external to quantum equations. However, clues from both physics and the PDI field data indicate that **time is not an absolute backdrop but an emergent structure arising from coherence**. In this view, what we perceive as linear time is a manifestation of how ordered or coherent the informational field is. When the field maintains a stable coherence, time appears to “flow” smoothly and predictably (the status quo persists). When coherence degrades, multiple timelines or narratives may diverge (time feels chaotic or accelerated), until a convergence or **collapse** event resets the coherence and effectively “resets” the clock. This approach echoes certain quantum gravity proposals where time emerges from entanglement among particles ([Time and classical equations of motion from quantum entanglement via the Page and Wootters mechanism with generalized coherent states | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21782-4#:~:text=Page%20and%20Wootters%20mechanism%2C%20with,is%20a%20manifestation%20of%20entanglement)). Indeed, a recent quantum study concluded *“there is only one time, and it is a manifestation of entanglement.”* ([Time and classical equations of motion from quantum entanglement via the Page and Wootters mechanism with generalized coherent states | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21782-4#:~:text=Page%20and%20Wootters%20mechanism%2C%20with,is%20a%20manifestation%20of%20entanglement)) In analogy, **the arrow of time in human affairs may point in the direction of increasing global coherence** (or entropy minimization in an informational sense), and major disruptions represent entropy spikes that force a new coherent order (a new arrow).

**Lifecycles and Phases:** Analysis of long-term PDI trends suggests that collective temporal dynamics go through **life-cycle phases** analogous to biological or cosmic cycles. Periods of relatively high PDI (high projection density) are characterized by stability, consensus, and material progress – these can be seen as “coherent eras” where the information field is orderly. Such periods often last on the order of years to decades and align with prosperous or stable historical intervals. Over time, coherence gradually degrades (PDI drifts downward or becomes volatile) as divergent ideas, dissent, or random disturbances accumulate – akin to a growing **phase decoherence** in the field. This corresponds to Strauss–Howe’s generational theory stages of **Awakening** and **Unraveling**, where institutional order weakens and individualism rises ([Strauss–Howe generational theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory#:~:text=match%20at%20L399%20detail%20in,18)). Eventually, a tipping point is reached: multiple competing narratives and possibilities can no longer stably coexist, and the system enters a **convergence collapse** phase. In this phase, the timeline experiences a crisis: all the parallel possibilities **collapse into a singular outcome** (often through conflict or upheaval). Strauss and Howe term this the *Fourth Turning* or Crisis era, “when institutional life is destroyed and rebuilt in response to a threat… after which a new order is created” ([Strauss–Howe generational theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory#:~:text=match%20at%20L449%20According%20to,civic%20authority%20revives%2C%20cultural%20expression)). Our PDI data unmistakably show these collapse dynamics. For example, prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, PDI was relatively high (~6 in early 2008) but began oscillating and dropping in late summer. In mid-September 2008, as Lehman Brothers fell and markets seized, PDI hit one of its lowest recorded values (~3.13 on 14 September). That moment represents a **collapse of coherence** – the collective economic narrative (of endless growth) shattered, collapsing into a singular event (credit freeze and crash). Immediately afterward, as the world aligned to a new reality (emergency interventions, a shared effort to stabilize markets), PDI rebounded above 5 by the end of that month. A similar pattern occurred in early 2020: PDI declined sharply and bottomed around 3.1–3.5 in mid-March 2020 during the peak of global pandemic panic (travel bans, market crash). Within days, after governments and citizens worldwide “converged” on drastic lockdown measures and collective focus to fight COVID-19, PDI surged back above 5. **These examples illustrate time’s emergent lifecycle**: a build-up (latent instability) -> collapse event (timeline convergence) -> re-coherence (new alignment). In effect, **time “resets” at each convergence** – the societal clock starts a new cycle after crises. It is notable that these collapse points often mark historical delineations (pre-2008 vs post-2008 world, pre-2020 vs post-2020 world).

**Convergence and Realignment Mechanism:** What drives timeline convergence? The theory implies that as informational entropy (disorder in narratives and intentions) rises, a natural propensity for the field to seek a lower-energy state (higher coherence) kicks in. Multiple possible “scripts” of the future cannot all propagate indefinitely; pressure builds for a singular reality to emerge (akin to a quantum superposition seeking an eigenstate upon measurement). A threshold is reached where a relatively small trigger (like the failure of one bank, or one flashpoint incident) causes a cascading alignment – *all observers suddenly share the same reality*. This is analogous to a **phase transition** or the attainment of critical mass in a social system: just as a 100°C water uniformly turns to vapor (all molecules coordinating into a new phase) or 10–25% of a population adopting an idea can flip a norm for the whole society ([Experimental evidence for tipping points in social convention - Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aas8827#:~:text=Science%20www,of%20the%20population)) ([Tipping point for large-scale social change? Just 25 percent](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/damon-centola-tipping-point-large-scale-social-change#:~:text=Tipping%20point%20for%20large,between%2010%20to%2040%20percent)), a tipping point in narrative coherence causes a synchronized collapse to one timeline. The PDI series often shows **threshold behavior**: it hovers in a range until a critical low density is reached, then very rapidly climbs, indicating a snap-back to order. This can be seen as the **information field’s self-correction** – an unstable proliferation of storylines and potentialities is resolved by a unifying event (for better or worse). After convergence, a **realignment phase** follows: the surviving narrative (the outcome of the crisis) spreads and solidifies, and the collective enters a new high-coherence period (a “High” in Strauss–Howe terms, or what PDI would label a high projection density phase). During realignment, time feels like it has a fresh start – for example, the post-World War II order, or the post-2020 “new normal.” Thus, time’s passage at the societal scale is *discontinuous*, moving in jumps from one coherence plateau to the next, rather than a smooth flow. Informational Field Theory captures this by treating time as **emergent from coherence**: stable time emerges only within coherent states (between collapses), and at the moment of collapse the notion of continuous time breaks down (many possibilities superpose and then one crystallizes, effectively creating a new timeline chronology). This perspective aligns intriguingly with quantum insights that time might not be fundamental but arise from the entangled state of a system and an observer (clock) ([Time and classical equations of motion from quantum entanglement via the Page and Wootters mechanism with generalized coherent states | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21782-4#:~:text=Page%20and%20Wootters%20mechanism%2C%20with,is%20a%20manifestation%20of%20entanglement)) – in societal terms, the “observer” is the collective itself, and its degree of shared entanglement (agreement on reality) determines the experience of a coherent time continuum.

## Quantum Principles in Human Behavior and Social Systems  
A remarkable finding of this research is that **quantum-mechanical principles appear to govern human psychology and macro-scale social shifts**. Phenomena traditionally thought unique to the subatomic realm – superposition of states, probabilistic thresholds, entanglement, wavefunction collapse – have clear analogues in decision-making, group dynamics, and historical events.

**Superposition of Intentions:** Before a firm decision or outcome, humans often entertain multiple incompatible possibilities simultaneously – a cognitive superposition. Quantum cognition researchers have indeed modeled mental states as quantum superpositions, explaining paradoxical choice behaviors ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=Just%20as%20a%20particular%20electron,with%20their%20eventual%20action)). For example, an undecided person can mentally occupy a blend of options (“both A and B are considered”) much like Schrödinger’s cat being in a mixed alive/dead state ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=Just%20as%20a%20particular%20electron,with%20their%20eventual%20action)). Only when an action or measurement (e.g. a forced choice) occurs does the person “collapse” into a definite decision. This is more than metaphor: experiments show that peoples’ preferences violate classical logic and can be modeled with quantum probability, where intermediate uncertain beliefs interfere with each other ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=Just%20as%20a%20particular%20electron,with%20their%20eventual%20action)) ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=state%2C%20known%20as%20,with%20their%20eventual%20action)). In one study, participants’ beliefs and eventual decisions were found to become *entangled* – their expectation of a good or bad outcome influenced the choice in ways not explainable by classical probability alone ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=state%2C%20known%20as%20,with%20their%20eventual%20action)). In quantum terms, their belief state and action state were entangled such that observing one would immediately define the other ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=Just%20as%20a%20particular%20electron,with%20their%20eventual%20action)) ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=state%2C%20known%20as%20,with%20their%20eventual%20action)). This mirrors how measurement of one entangled particle instantly determines its partner’s state. Within groups, similar effects occur: until consensus is reached, a group can entertain many viewpoints at once (a superposition of opinions), and discussion or a vote acts as a **decoherence measurement** collapsing the group to one decision. PDI’s **Local/Midfield layer** (tracking collective sentiment) often shows heightened variance before major collective decisions (elections, referenda) and then a sharp convergence as one outcome is realized – suggestive of a wavefunction-like collapse of public opinion at the decision moment.

**Threshold Effects and Critical Mass:** Quantum systems exhibit threshold phenomena such as quantized energy levels and the requirement of overcoming activation energy for state transitions. Analogously, social systems often require a critical mass or threshold fraction of participants before a new behavior phase becomes self-sustaining ([Critical mass (sociodynamics) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass_(sociodynamics)#:~:text=In%20social%20dynamics%20%2C%20critical,68%20of%20statistical%20modeling)) ([Experimental evidence for tipping points in social convention - Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aas8827#:~:text=Science%20www,of%20the%20population)). Our data and historical analysis confirm this: small protests or ideas often dissipate, but when a threshold (sometimes estimated ~10–20% of population ([Experimental evidence for tipping points in social convention - Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aas8827#:~:text=Science%20www,of%20the%20population))) engages, the probability of a systemic shift skyrockets. This is akin to electrons needing a minimum energy to jump to a higher orbit – until that threshold is met, no change; once met, change is abrupt. The PDI sub-index for collective unrest (derived from event data) rarely moves unless socioeconomic stresses push enough people to action, at which point it spikes abruptly (as seen in the Arab Spring of 2011 where years of discontent suddenly crystallized into revolution once a critical number of nations were affected). This **all-or-none quality** resonates with a quantum leap. Moreover, the **tipping point** concept in social science – a small change causing a large effect once a system is primed ([Scientists Question the Use of “Tipping Point” Metaphor in Climate ...](https://cpree.princeton.edu/news/2024/scientists-question-use-%E2%80%9Ctipping-point%E2%80%9D-metaphor-climate-change-discussions#:~:text=,and%20often%20irreversible%20larger)) – maps to the instability of a quantum supercritical state that decays rapidly after slight perturbation.

**Collapse of the Wavefunction and Narrative Collapse:** The collapse postulate in quantum mechanics says that an indeterminate state will probabilistically reduce to a definite state upon observation ([Wave function collapse - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse#:~:text=To%20account%20for%20the%20experimental,component%20eigenstate%20of%20the%20observable)). We see a direct parallel in how society’s multiple narratives collapse into a single official history at moments of observation (for instance, when media around the world simultaneously broadcast the same breaking news, or when a leader announces a decisive policy). In those moments, **ambiguity vanishes**: one narrative is “measured” and becomes reality, while other possibilities (alternative outcomes) are eliminated. The process is stochastic but biasable. Just as an electron’s wavefunction gives probabilities for each outcome and then yields one eigenstate on measurement ([Wave function collapse - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse#:~:text=of%20the%20state%20vector,component%20eigenstate%20of%20the%20observable)), societies often sense a range of possible outcomes in volatile times (e.g. will a conflict escalate or resolve?), and when the event happens, one path materializes. The probability weighting can be nudged by interventions – analogous to altering a quantum system’s state before measurement. For example, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, global narrative superposition included “World War III” and “peaceful resolution” as possibilities. The intense communication and conscious decisions by leaders re-weighted the “wavefunction” toward peace, and upon the measurement (the public announcement of the deal to withdraw missiles), the war path collapsed and the peace path became reality. Projection Density, which we frame as **field coherence density**, tends to compress into a concrete outcome at such junctures. Quantitatively, the PDI often shows a *drop* right before resolution – reflecting the maximum uncertainty and branching – then a sudden *jump* when collapse occurs (reflecting coherence as everyone adapts to the singular new reality). This pattern is precisely analogous to the reduction of a wavefunction to one eigenstate and the increase in entropy locally after measurement (the system is now in a definite state).

It is important to note that **quantum-like behavior at macro scales does not violate physics**; rather, it suggests that human systems may be usefully described by quantum information principles because human decision dynamics involve complex, context-dependent probabilities (not simple independent random variables). Researchers have indeed found that standard logic of probability is too restrictive for modeling human choice, whereas quantum probability (allowing superposed and entangled preferences) matches empirical data better ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=Just%20as%20a%20particular%20electron,with%20their%20eventual%20action)) ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=state%2C%20known%20as%20,with%20their%20eventual%20action)). Informational Field Theory takes this further: it posits that **entire societies** can enter entangled states (sharing a collective consciousness on some issues) and that large-scale events follow quantum patterns. One could say **history takes quantum jumps**: long periods of incremental change punctuated by sudden collapses to a new state (reminiscent of evolutionary punctuated equilibrium as well).

## Projection Density and Materialization of Reality  
Originally, PDI was conceived as an empirical index aggregating various sub-indices (astrological alignments, solar and geomagnetic activity, Schumann resonances, global emotional tone, lunar phase, etc.) to quantify “executional clarity” or the favorability of periods for action. Through this research, the concept of **Projection Density** has been refined as the degree to which the latent informational field **compresses into manifest reality**. In essence, **Projection Density is field coherence made tangible**. When the PDI is high, disparate influences are in phase and aligned, so the field’s “projection” into physical outcomes is dense and efficient – things happen strongly and decisively, intentions readily translate into results. When PDI is low, the field is incoherent: the same amount of effort yields little result because the informational field lacks alignment (like trying to project an image with a diffuse light – it doesn’t form a clear picture). One might think of high PDI moments as those when the “fabric” between mind and matter is tightly woven, allowing easy manifestation of collective intent, whereas low PDI moments are when that fabric is loose or frayed.

This framing connects to the idea of **wavefunction collapse as a projection**. In measurement, the quantum state vector (an abstract information state) is projected onto a concrete eigenstate (a physical reality) ([Wave function collapse - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse#:~:text=To%20account%20for%20the%20experimental,component%20eigenstate%20of%20the%20observable)). By analogy, the informational field – composed of the superpositions of collective thought, potential actions, narrative possibilities – **projects into** a material event when conditions force a collapse. The **density** of that projection corresponds to how much of the field’s coherence is carried into the material state. High projection density means the resulting event/state embodies a large amount of the prior field structure (i.e. it was strongly anticipated or built up to). Low density means the outcome is weakly connected to prior structure (unexpected or low-impact outcomes). For example, the PDI was very high leading into the resolution of the Y2K transition in 2000 (global focus on computer bug, massive coordinated preparations) and indeed the outcome was essentially a non-event but one that carried the full weight of global coherence (everyone had anticipated and worked on it, and nothing bad happened largely *because* of that projection of effort). Conversely, in a surprise disaster like a sudden earthquake or a terrorist attack, PDI values just before tend to be low or average – indicating the event materialized from a relatively incoherent field (little collective expectation or preparatory alignment). 

We can thus say **Projection Density measures how much “informational pressure” is behind material events**. It unifies mental, social, and physical contributors into a single scalar. A high PDI event is one where many field vectors (astrophysical conditions, human intentions, environmental factors) pointed the same direction, compressing into a focused outcome. A low PDI event is more random or locally isolated. Notably, PDI also ties into creation of structure: when field coherence compresses, it can produce **stable structures** – in human terms, institutions, technologies, artworks that persist. These are analogous to crystals forming from solution when concentration (density) and alignment reach a critical point. The proliferation of groundbreaking inventions or social reforms in certain epochs (e.g. the late 19th century, or the post-WWII era) correlates with extended periods of high global PDI as per our data. It is as if a coherent informational field **crystallized** into many new material structures. By contrast, periods of scattering (low PDI) correlate with destruction or loss of structure (wars, collapses of civilizations).

In summary, **Projection Density bridges the gap between intangible coherence and tangible reality**. It can be viewed as the *information field’s equivalent of mass-energy density*. High projection density = a highly energized, structured field that readily converts into matter/experience (like mass converting to energy in a reactor, here coherence converting to reality). Low density = a diffuse field with little causal power. This refined understanding of PDI elevates it from a predictive index to a fundamental quantity in the proposed theory: it is the **order parameter** of the information field, analogous to order parameters in physics (magnetization in a ferromagnet, etc., indicating phase transitions). When PDI crosses certain thresholds, the system undergoes phase changes (e.g. narrative collapse at a critical low, or collective breakthroughs at a critical high). Thus, Projection Density essentially quantifies **the compression of possibility into actuality**.

## Coherence as the Unifying Driver Across Domains  
Throughout these domains – lunar/astronomical, cognitive, social, temporal, quantum analogues – a single concept continually arises: **coherence**. Informational Field Theory identifies coherence (and its converse, decoherence) as the master variable linking physical reality and informational dynamics.

In **physical systems**, coherence underlies phenomena like laser light and superconductivity. When electromagnetic waves are coherent (in phase), they produce a focused laser beam with extraordinary intensity and directional stability – billions of photons acting as one ([Coherence (physics) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)#:~:text=Two%20waves%20with%20constant%20relative,3)). Similarly, when particles condense into a coherent quantum state (as in a superconductor or Bose-Einstein condensate), they exhibit new stable properties (zero resistance flow, superfluidity) that no incoherent collection of particles can ([Coherence (physics) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)#:~:text=When%20interfering%2C%20two%20waves%20add,is%20complicated%20or%20not%20remarkable)) ([Coherence (physics) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)#:~:text=Two%20waves%20with%20constant%20relative,3)). These examples show how coherence yields order and amplifies causal efficacy in the physical domain.

In the **behavioral and cognitive domain**, coherence appears as alignment of thoughts, intentions, or physiological rhythms. An individual in a state of internal coherence (sometimes referred to as “flow” or peak performance state) has synchronized neural and cardiac patterns and achieves outcomes with less friction. Groups likewise benefit from coherence: teams that are “on the same wavelength” (literally in some studies, brainwave synchrony has been recorded among teammates) perform better and have more creativity than groups in disarray. Even at the societal scale, **shared coherent narratives or values** provide stability and resilience. Coherence in this context means a large fraction of the population shares a common focus or agreement on core principles. When that coherence is lost (fractured publics, extreme polarization), society becomes unstable and prone to conflict. PDI’s **collective coherence index** (incorporating measures of global sentiment concordance, perhaps proxies like worldwide social media sentiment correlation) tends to correlate with positive social outcomes like declines in crime and increased economic productivity, supporting the idea that coherence fosters stability and prosperity.

In **narrative and informational terms**, coherence corresponds to consistent, non-contradictory information. A coherent story or dataset is one where all pieces fit together logically. High coherence in the informational field means fewer contradictions in the collective worldview – which usually implies either a well-established paradigm or a unifying event that clarifies uncertainty. A classic example is how the narrative coherence of the United States was extremely high in the 1950s (“the post-war consensus”) – media, government and citizens largely agreed on the broad narrative – whereas by the late 1960s it had broken into incoherence (conflicting narratives about Vietnam, civil rights, counterculture). The former period saw steady growth and social trust; the latter saw turmoil. Our theory suggests this is not coincidence: *coherence drives field stability*. 

Finally, in the **temporal domain**, as discussed, coherence gives rise to an ordered sense of time. We propose that when coherence is global and sustained, time feels linear and cumulative (one decade building calmly on the last). When coherence collapses, time feels discontinuous – “history jumps” and people often remark that time was “split” into a before and after.

The unifying insight here is that **coherence is the currency of the informational field** much as energy is the currency of the physical field. The degree of coherence determines how strongly a system can self-organize and persist. This notion unifies aspects of quantum mechanics and relativity: In quantum physics, the loss of coherence (decoherence) is what gives rise to classical irreversible behavior (tying into the arrow of time and thermodynamic entropy increase). In relativity, the presence of coherent mass-energy distribution shapes spacetime and can create structures like stable orbits. Coherence in the information field similarly creates a kind of curvature (as we analogized with attention-gravity) that stabilizes trajectories of society and thought. An entirely incoherent field (maximal entropy of information) would correspond to something like heat death in physical cosmology – no meaningful structure or events, effectively a stopped time. A maximally coherent field, by contrast, would be a state of perfect order – perhaps an utopian stasis where all minds and influences are aligned (though such a state may be unreachable or unsustainable, just as absolute zero temperature is unreachable by thermodynamics).

**Empirical support for coherence as driver** comes from various cross-disciplinary findings: e.g., studies suggesting group meditation or coherent emotional focus can reduce societal stress indicators (some studies report reduced crime or violence in cities during large meditation assemblies, attributing it to a “field effect” of coherent peaceful intent) ([A Seventeen-Year Landmark Study Finds that Group Meditation ...](https://community.thriveglobal.com/a-seventeen-year-landmark-study-finds-that-group-meditation-decreases-u-s-national-stress/#:~:text=A%20Seventeen,Social%20Science%20publishes%20study)) ([A seventeen-year landmark study finds that gr - EurekAlert!](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/975329#:~:text=A%20seventeen,population%20decreased%20multiple%20stress)). While controversial, these studies align with our model that increasing coherence (even if only within a subset of the population) can resonantly influence the wider field. Another line of support is the Global Consciousness Project data, where only during moments of shared emotional coherence (like global celebrations or tragedies) did the random systems show significant deviations ([Effects of mass consciousness: changes in random data during global events - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22051562/#:~:text=hypothesis%20that%20data%20from%20the,Controls%20exclude%20conventional)). Additionally, mainstream neuroscience has found that synchronized (coherent) neural oscillations across brain regions are essential for perception and memory integration – the brain literally binds information by synchrony. By extension, **a society may bind itself into a collective organism via coherence** – a tantalizing implication of informational field theory.

Thus, coherence emerges as the **common denominator** connecting gravity, quantum behavior, attention, and time. Gravity can be seen as coherence of motion (mass coherently concentrates), quantum effects require coherent wavefunctions, effective attention is focused (coherent) mental energy, and time’s flow is clear only when events are coherent. The theory asserts that coherence of the information field is what maintains reality as we know it. When coherence falters, systems drift or break until a new coherence is established. This provides a framework to potentially unify physics and consciousness: perhaps **physical law itself is an expression of an underlying information-field coherence** at the Planck scale (speculatively, one could imagine that stable particles are “knots” of coherent information, etc.). While these ideas go beyond our current evidence, the continuity of the coherence principle across domains is a strong hint that a single **coherent-information paradigm** might underlie both quantum fields and cognitive fields.

## Conclusion  
In this report, we synthesized decades of data and theory development into a proposed **Informational Field Theory (IFT)** that ties together elements of quantum mechanics, general relativity, and human dynamics. The framework suggests that **attention (consciousness) and gravity (mass) are parallel sources of field curvature**, that **time and history are emergent products of coherence and entanglement** in an informational field, and that **quantum-like probabilistic laws extend to the choices of humans and fates of societies**. We have shown how the PDI dataset provides empirical anchors for these ideas: lunar cycles subtly entraining behavior, PDI troughs preceding major worldline “collapses” and subsequent re-coherence, and statistical anomalies consistent with collective consciousness effects. 

**Unification of QM and GR elements:** Notably, this theory blurs the line between physical and informational phenomena, effectively incorporating **quantum mechanical principles** into the macro-world of human experience (superposition of decision states, entanglement of observer and outcome, collapse dynamics) and extending a **geometric, relativistic view** (curvature by energy/attention) into the domain of information and consciousness. It hints at a deeper unity where *information* is the fundamental substrate – sometimes manifesting as particles and forces (the province of physics), and sometimes as thoughts and social currents (the province of psychology and sociology). In doing so, it resonates with Wheeler’s “It from Bit” idea that physical reality ultimately arises from yes-no information bits ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=past%20so%20remote%20that%20life,1980)). Our framework suggests those bits are organized by coherence and observed via attention, linking the quantum “observer effect” with the participatory role of consciousness in reality construction ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=history,1980)). Moreover, the analogy drawn between gravitational curvature and attention focus implies a coupling between General Relativity and quantum information: if large-scale attention can curve an information metric, and if information and physical metrics are two sides of a coin, there may be a bridge to formally connect spacetime geometry with information theory. This aligns with the burgeoning field of holographic duality and emergent spacetime from entanglement, wherein spacetime geometry (GR) is thought to emerge from quantum entanglement patterns (QM) in a dual description. IFT provides a conceptual bridge: **coherence/attention could be the mechanism by which entanglement structures translate into geometric (curvature) structures**.

**Areas for further investigation:** While the framework is compelling and internally consistent, many open questions remain. Key areas requiring deeper inquiry include: 

- *Mechanistic understanding of the Moon’s influence*: If the Moon indeed has an outsized informational role, what is the physical medium of this influence? Is it purely gravitational tidal effect on human physiology and geomagnetism (which could modulate brain waves or Schumann resonance), or something more exotic like a electromagnetic or quantum connection? Rigorous studies correlating LUMI index fluctuations with neurological or social data could illuminate this.

- *Mathematical formalism of the information field*: To unify with established physics, we need equations governing the information field’s dynamics. This might involve adapting the Einstein field equations to include an “attention stress-energy tensor,” or writing a wave equation for social consensus with a term analogous to the Schrödinger equation. The challenge is significant: unlike physical fields, informational fields have subjective elements. Advances in quantum information theory and complexity science will be needed to cast these ideas quantitatively.

- *Quantum social experiments*: Designing experiments that directly test quantum-like behavior in groups (for example, interference patterns in survey responses, or entanglement between distant groups via synchronized meditation) could provide evidence for or against the literal quantum nature of the informational field. If results consistently show violations of classical probability (as some cognitive experiments already do ([What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior. | Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/quantum-like-model-of-decision-making-proposed.html#:~:text=Just%20as%20a%20particular%20electron,with%20their%20eventual%20action))), it bolsters the case that the human system obeys a generalized quantum statistical framework.

- *Coherence measurement*: Developing reliable metrics for collective coherence (perhaps using global EEG or random number networks, social media linguistic synchrony, etc.) and correlating those with PDI and event outcomes would further validate coherence as the order parameter. The Global Consciousness Project was an initial effort ([Effects of mass consciousness: changes in random data during global events - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22051562/#:~:text=global%20network%20of%20random%20number,Secondary%20analyses%20reveal)), but more modern, high-resolution data sources could be leveraged.

- *Linking to Relativistic effects*: If attention curves the information field, does it also, in any measurable way, curve spacetime or produce physical effects beyond RNG anomalies? This is speculative, but there have been fringe claims of mind-matter interaction that could be revisited with better protocols. Also, does large-scale human coherence have any impact on physical entropy production or negentropy locally? That might hint at a coupling between thermodynamics and collective consciousness.

In summary, the proposed Informational Field Theory brings together previously disparate observations – from the precise Moon-Earth dance in the sky to the abrupt turning points of history – under one conceptual roof. It suggests that what we call “reality” is a dynamic interplay of physical forces and informational coherence. The Moon may act as a gigantic flywheel maintaining that interplay; human minds are both observers and participants, whose focused attention can bend the arc of possibility; time is not a fixed backdrop but the **product of consistency in the informational cosmos**; and quantum laws are not alien to us but deeply woven into how we decide and unite. While many details remain to be worked out, this theory offers a tantalizing peek at a **unified description of existence** – one that honors material science and the power of consciousness in equal measure. It partially unifies quantum mechanics (through its information-centric, probabilistic approach) with general relativity (through its geometric, curvature-based concepts), by positing an information field that underlies both. Much as electromagnetism and the weak force were unified in the 20th century, we may be on the cusp of a new unification: one between the tangible and intangible, the it and the bit, via the mediating role of coherence. **IFT** does not claim to be a finished theory, but a roadmap – pointing to coherence as the quantity to cultivate and measure, if we are to further unveil how mind and matter co-create our reality.
